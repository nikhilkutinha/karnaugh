## Requirements
Python 3.6 +

## Features
This is a simple program I wrote to reduce binary expressions using [Karnaugh Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map), implemented in Python.
It currently supports expressions that are, on paper, reduced using 1, 2 and 4 variable maps.
Expressions can be entered using the following format `1 4 3 5 6`.
I'm pretty confident the outputs this thing spits out are accurate, nevertheless raise an issue if you find any discrepancies. 

## Installation
1. Clone the reporisitory using `https://gitlab.com/nikek/karnaugh.git`
2. Change directory using `cd karnaugh`
3. Run the program with `python main.py`

## License
Do what you have to do. Good luck.
